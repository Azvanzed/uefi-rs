# uefi-raw - [Unreleased]

## Added
- Added `AbsolutePointerProtocol`.
- Added `SimpleFileSystemProtocol` and related types.

## Changed
- `{install,reinstall,uninstall}_protocol_interface` now take `const` interface pointers.
- `{un}install_multiple_protocol_interfaces` are now defined as c-variadic
  function pointers. The ABI is `extern "C"` until such time as
  [`extended_varargs_abi_support`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/100189)
  is stabilized.
